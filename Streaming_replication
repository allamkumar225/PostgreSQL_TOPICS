what is streaming replication ?
SR is copy the data from primary server to standby server continous
in real time we called has standby is called as mirror image of primary server.
(or)
---> Streaming replication is a process where WAL (Write Ahead Log) data is continuously streamed from the primary server to one or more standby servers to keep them synchronized in near real-time.
--->In streaming replication, the primary server does not copy full data files; instead, it sends WAL records (changes) to the standby server, which replays them to keep data synchronized.
if full data is copied every time:
❌ Slow
❌ High network usage
❌ Not scalable
So PostgreSQL uses WAL-based replication

Used for:-
---------
1. High Availability:- always access
High Availability means the database is always accessible even if the primary server fails.
(I) If primary (Kumar) goes down
(II) Standby (Amar) can be promoted
(III) Application continues working
Streaming replication provides high availability by maintaining a standby server that can take over if the primary fails.
2. Disaster Recovery:- easy to recover data
Disaster Recovery means recovering data in case of failures like crash, hardware failure, or data corruption.
(I)  Standby has recent copy of data
(II) Minimal data loss (depends on sync/async)
(III)Fast recovery
Streaming replication helps in disaster recovery by maintaining a near real-time copy of data on a standby server.
3. Read Scaling:- Read Scaling means distributing read queries to standby servers to reduce load on the primary server.
✔ Primary → Write operations
✔ Standby → Read operations
