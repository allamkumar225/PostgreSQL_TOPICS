Asynchronous Replication:- by default Sr is asynchronous mode
primary server doesnot wait for standby and fast performance and possible data lose. 
example:-- Primary (Master) → sends WAL → Standby (slave)

synchronous Replication:- primary wait for standby conformation and No data lose and slight delay in performance.
example:- Commit happens only after standby receives WAL.

with replication slot:-
