3. Full backup(entire database) --> entire database (can be logical or physical)

4. Incremental Backup(changes only) --> Backup only changes since last backup

5. Differential Backup(changes since full) --> Backup changes since last full backup

6. Continuous Archiving(WAL backup (log-based backup)) --> Uses Write-Ahead Log(WAL) files, and Helps in Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)

7. Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) / continous backup(restore specific time) --> Restore database to a specific time 
   combination of Base backup and WAL archiving.

8. Snapshot Backup --> Uses storage-level snapshots like LVM.

9. Hot Backup (DB running) --> backup taken while database is running

10. cold Backup (DB stopped)--> Backup taken when database is stopped
